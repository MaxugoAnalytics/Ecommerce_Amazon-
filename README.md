## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
   - Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Investigated patterns in order statuses, fulfillment methods, and product categories.
   - Visualized key trends using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Built models to predict the likelihood of order cancellation based on historical data.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Derived actionable insights and proposed recommendations for improving operational efficiency.

## **Findings**
1. **Key Drivers of Success**:
   - Expedited shipping methods and fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) led to better delivery success rates.
   - Popular states for orders included Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, emphasizing these as demand hubs.

2. **Cancellation Trends**:
   - Merchant-fulfilled orders had higher cancellation rates compared to Amazon-fulfilled orders.
   - Specific categories, such as Western dresses, experienced higher cancellations due to potential sizing or quality issues.

3. **Customer Preferences**:
   - Sets and kurtas were the most ordered product categories.
   - XL and 3XL sizes dominated sales, highlighting significant customer preference.

---

## **Conclusion**
- Orders fulfilled by Amazon with expedited shipping achieved the highest delivery success rates. Merchant fulfillment showed room for improvement in terms of cancellations and customer satisfaction.
- Seasonal and weekly sales patterns revealed higher order volumes during weekends, particularly Saturdays, suggesting alignment with customer shopping behavior.
- Products with promotional offers saw higher order quantities, emphasizing the importance of strategic discounting.

## **Recommendations**
1. **Optimize Fulfillment**:
   - Encourage merchants to adopt Amazon's fulfillment services (FBA) to improve delivery success rates.
   - Streamline merchant logistics to reduce cancellations.

2. **Enhance Product Listings**:
   - Improve size charts and product descriptions to reduce returns and cancellations, especially for categories like Western dresses.

3. **Leverage Regional Insights**:
   - Focus marketing and inventory allocation on high-demand states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.

4. **Promotional Strategies**:
   - Conduct targeted promotions in underperforming regions while maintaining a robust strategy for high-demand areas.

5. **Predictive Analytics**:
   - Implement machine learning models to predict orders at risk of cancellation and proactively address issues.
